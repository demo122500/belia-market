# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Guide
## npx create-react-app ./
## npm install react-router-dom
## install specific version of bootstrap (add "bootstrap": "^4.1.3") to package.json
## npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
## npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components

## Day 1 - Working on the project Header
## Day 2 - Working on the project Location feature.

## Day 3 - Working on Countrylist.
<!-- The first step can be found on src/app.js -->
<!-- The second step is passing the values to CountryDropdown parent component can be found on src/Header/<CountryDropdown/> note: dont forget to define context -->
<!-- Third is passing the countries values to CountryDropdown main component can be found on src/CountryDropdown/CountryDropdown.js note: dont forget to define context-->

## Defining the countryList tab selection, when the user select the specific tab of the country list, that tab become highlighted by changing the background to #e2e2e2
<!-- First step defining the logic can be found in src/CountryDropdown/CountryDropdown.js -->
